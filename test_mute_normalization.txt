Test Case: All Processors Muted + Normalization Enabled

Setup:
1. Enable normalization (set gain to +6 dB for example)
2. Mute all 4 processors (HC, SC, SL, FL all muted)
3. Set Mix to 100%
4. Set Output Gain to 0 dB

Expected Result:
- Signal should pass through with +6 dB normalization gain applied

Current Behavior (if bug exists):
- Signal passes through without normalization gain (unity gain passthrough)

Code Analysis:
- Line 1097: buffer.applyGain(normGain) - normalization applied to buffer
- Line 1106: originalInputBuffer.makeCopyOf(buffer) - captures AFTER norm
- Line 1171: pristine = originalInputBuffer - should have normalization

The bug might be in the comment/logic, not the actual code flow.
Let me verify by adding explicit normalization handling.
